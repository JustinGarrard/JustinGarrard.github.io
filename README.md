If you are going to add a new field to the dropdown bar, don't forget to add it across all the pages!
  Also, don't use construction.html as a "placeholder" or alter it in anyway.  If you create a page without finished content, better of copying construction.html code to your page so that you don't have to go back and change links from construction.html to the new page once it's finished. I recognize this makes development weird once the site is live, but that's a bridge we'll cross when we need to (I'm thinking version control through Git).
  construction.html contains all the original unaltered code that will make the persistent banners and footers work, need basically all the code there except for the "Whoops, Webmaster at work...." stuff.
